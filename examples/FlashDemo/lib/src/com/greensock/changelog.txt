--------------------
TimelineLite	0.96
TimelineMax		0.96
	- If the label isn't found in TimelineLite.getLabelTime(), it will now return -1 instead of 0 which helps determine if a label exists.
	- Now TimelineMax.tweenTo() won't do anything if you pass in a non-existent label. (previously it would default to a time of 0)

TweenMax		11.099991
OverwriteManager 5.4
TimelineMax		0.941
TweenPlugin		1.3
	- Altered AUTO overwriting code so that if all of a tween's tweening properties have been overwritten, the entire tween is killed (previously, the tween could live and its onComplete/onUpdate would still fire)
	- Fixed bug in AS3 version of TimelineMax's getLabelBefore(), getLabelAfter(), and currentLabel
	

9/12/09, 5PM CST
-----------------
TweenLite		11.09999

8/22/2009, 2:30AM CST
---------------------
TimelineLite	0.91
TransformMatrixPlugin 0.95
	- Fixed bug that caused odd behavior when using insertMultiple() with tweens that had a timeScale other than 1.
	- Changed the behavior of transformMatrix plugin to more closely match the Flash IDE's way of skewing
	- Altered the filter plugins so that you can use a regular BitmapFilter object (like GlowFilter, BlurFilter, etc.) to define vars in tweens.

TweenMax		11.09993
TimelineLite	0.88
TimelineMax		0.88
SimpleTimeline	0.88
TweenCore		0.88
	- Added invalidate() method to TweenCore (which means it's available in TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and TimelineMax) 
	- Fixed bug that could cause the player to crash if a TweenCore was added to a timeline after the timeline had completed and was then reversed.
	- Fixed bug in AS2 version of TweenMax.setDestination()
	

7/16/2009, 9AM CST
------------------
OverwriteManager	5.1
	- Added ALL_AFTER mode to OverwriteManager
	- Fixed bug in OverwriteManager that was introduced in 5.06


7/15/2009, 2:30PM CST
---------------------
TimelineLite	0.87
TimelineMax		0.87
	- Removed shorthand syntax in TimelineLite/Max in order to prevent confusion ("why won't insert()/append()/prepend() 
	  accommodate the shorthand syntax?") and reduce the file size. This also means that there's no need for the tweenClass 
	  special parameter.
	- Fixed minor ASDoc formatting problems.


7/15/2009, 1:45AM CST
---------------------
TweenLite		11.09992

TimelineLite	0.86
TimelineMax		0.86
TweenNano		0.86
	- IMPORTANT: Changed base package name from "gs" to "com.greensock" in order to comply with industry standards. I realize this may cause some problems
	  with existing code, but with all the enhancements and changes in v11, now seemed like the best time to make the change. Sorry for any inconvenience!
	- Fixed some documentation

7/13/2009, 4:45PM CST
---------------------
TweenMax		11.09991
	- Fixed bug in allTo() and allFrom() and allFromTo() that was introduced last version (when removing the "$" signs).

------------------
TweenLite		11.0999
TweenMax		11.0999

OverwriteManager	5.05
TimelineLite	0.83
TimelineMax		0.83
TweenNano		0.84
SimpleTimeline	0.83
Tweenable		0.84
	- Fixed bug in timeline classes that prevented getChildren() from returning nested tweens/timelines properly

	- Changed the package for the core tweening classes from gs.core.tween to simply gs.core
	- Changed the package for the vars classes (TweenLiteVars, TweenMaxVars, etc.) from gs.utils.tween to gs.data
	- Removed "$" from all parameters


7/1/2009, 1PM CST
-----------------
TweenLite		11.0996
TweenMax		11.0996
TweenLt			0.83
Tweenable		0.83
	- Removed TweenLite.removeTween() and TweenMax.removeTween() in favor of a common kill() method. So what used to be TweenLite.removeTween(myTween) is now simply myTween.kill();
	- Added kill() to all tweenables including TimelineLite and TimelineMax.


6/29/09, 4:30PM CST
-------------------
TweenMax		11.0995
TimelineLite	0.82
TimelineMax		0.82
	- Fixed bug that could cause tweens to be rendered incorrectly in a TimelineMax that was repeated and restarted (in rare circumstances)
	- Fixed bug in TweenMax that could render a tween incorrectly if the "time" property is set during a yoyo phase.
	

6/22/09, 2:45PM CST
-------------------
TweenMax 		11.0994
TimelineMax		0.81
	- Fixed bug in TweenMax.from() that could cause it to incorrectly render the first frame.


6/16/09, 9:30AM CST
----------------
TweenLite		11.0991
TweenMax		11.0993
TimelineLite	0.8
TimelineMax		0.8
Tweenable		0.8
TweenLt			0.8
	- Added new TweenLt class that is a super-lightweight (1.6k) version of TweenLite without plugin capability, OverwriteManager integration, and a few other features. TweenLt is not recommended unless you absolutely cannot afford the extra 2.4k that the regular TweenLite class would cost.
	- Prevented timelines from rendering times less than zero or greater than the totalDuration. 
	- Fixed very minor bug in TweenMax.isTweening()
	- Moved the ALIGN constants into their own TweenAlign class. (TweenAlign.START, TweenAlign.NORMAL, and TweenAlign.SEQUENCE)
	- Optimized some minor code in the easing equations.
	- Prevented TimelineLite/Max instances from having children with negative startTimes (they'll automatically move all children if a negative startTime is encountered so that the first child starts at zero)


6/3/2009, 6PM CST
-----------------
TweenMax		11.0991
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TweenMax not to be able to restart after it completes.


6/1/2009, 5:20PM CST
--------------------
TimelineLite	0.7
TimelineMax		0.7
TweenLite		11.099
TweenMax		11.099
Tweenable		0.7
SimpleTimeline	0.7
	- Fixed bug that caused onStart to only fire the first time through a tween/timeline
	- Fixed issue that could cause a zero-duration tween/timeline to not render correctly if its parent timeline was rendered at a time that preceded the start time of the zero-duration tween/timeline


5/27/2009, 11:20AM CST
----------------------
TimelineLite 	0.69
	- Fixed bug that could cause timelines to get ignored in the rendering queue if they were created with zero tweens, immediately paused, and then populated, and subsequently unpaused.


5/26/2009, 10:45PM CST
----------------------
TimelineLite	0.68
TimelineMax	0.68
	- Fixed bug in rendering a reversed timeline where some tweens or nested timelines could be skipped


5/23/09, 11:45PM CST
--------------------
TweenLite		11.0988
	- Fixed bug in TweenLite that could cause immediate renders to be skipped.


5/23/09, 2:00PM CST
-------------------
TweenLite		11.0987
TweenMax		11.0987
TimelineLite		0.67
TimelineMax		0.67
	- Added "suppressEvent" capabilities throughout the classes. This is particularly useful in the timeline gotoAndStop(), gotoAndPlay(), goto(), and restart() methods because you can skip to a different time/position without having any onUpdate, onComplete, onReverseComplete, etc. callbacks or events triggered.
	- Added logic that allows the "immediateRender" special property to be honored if it is passed in through the "from" vars in TweenMax.allFromTo() and TweenMax.fromTo(). (previously it was only honored if it was passed through the "to" vars object)
	- Fixed bug that could cause tweens inside nested timelines that start at exactly zero seconds to render incorrectly


5/22/09, 9:30AM CST
-------------------
TimelineLite	0.66
TimelineMax	0.66
	- Fixed bug that could cause tweens to be skipped in the rendering queue when their start and end times were between the last render and the current one.


5/12/2009, 11:55PM CST
----------------------
TweenMax	11.0985
TimelineLite	0.65
TimelineMax	0.65
SimpleTimeline	0.63
	- Now if a TimelineLite or TimelineMax contains a paused child tween/timeline, it will not complete (calling an onComplete or firing a COMPLETE event) until the child is unpaused.
	- Fixed bug in TweenMax.pauseAll()
	- Fixed bug that could cause odd behavior if certain actions were performed on a TimelineLite/Max when it was paused
	- Fixed bug in MotionBlurPlugin that prevented it from rendering properly initially if the tween was restarted or set back to a progress of zero.


5/8/2009, 2:05PM CST
--------------------
TimelineLite 	0.64
TimelineMax 	0.64
SimpleTimeline	0.62
	- Fixed bug that could cause an infinite loop under very specific circumstances


5/6/2009, 7PM CST
-----------------
TweenLite	11.0984
TweenMax	11.0984
TimelineLite	0.63
TimelineMax	0.63
	- Added ScrollRectPlugin
	- Added a list of all plugins to the top of TweenLite and TweenMax to make it easy to activate/deactivate them.
	- Fixed bug in TweenMax's timeScale and globalTimeScale properties
	- Improved performance in timeline classes slightly
	- Fixed minor bug in MotionBlurPlugin
	- Minor bug fixes


5/4/2009, 9:30PM CST
--------------------
TweenLite	11.0982
TweenMax	11.0983
TimelineLite	0.62
TimelineMax	0.62
	- Minor performance improvements


5/4/2009, 5PM CST
-----------------
TweenMax	11.0982
TimelineLite	0.61
TimelineMax	0.61
	- Added onRepeat, onRepeatParams, onReverseComplete, and onReverseCompleteParams special properties to TweenMax and TimelineMax
	- Added onReverseComplete and onReverseCompleteParams to TimelineLite
	- Added onStart callback functionality to TimelineMax
	- Eliminated code that maintained backwards compatibility with the old "loop" and "yoyo" special properties in TweenMax. It seemed like it would cause more confusion than help.	
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TweenMax/TimelineLite/Max to incorrectly report its "progress" property immediately after being reversed
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TweenMax/TimelineLite/Max to render incorrectly when its progress/totalProgress/time/totalTime property was set immediately after being reversed
	


5/1/2009, 11:15PM CST
---------------------
TweenLite	11.0981
TweenMax	11.0981
TimelineLite	0.6
TimelineMax	0.6
SimpleTimeline	0.6
Tweenable	0.6
	- **IMPORTANT** By default, NO plugins are activated in TweenLite. Previously 7 plugins were activated by default in order to maintain backwards compatibility. However, after asking the community for input, the VAST majority strongly recommended removing the activation code from inside TweenLite to minimize the file size. TweenMax still has the same plugins activated that it always had.
	- Changed the way reversing affects time/totalTime/progress/totalProgress so that they always reflect the tween's/timeline's forward position regardless of reversing.
	- renderTime() renders consistently (according to a tween's/timeline's forward orientation) now regardless of the tween's/timeline's reversed state.


4/30/2009, 12:09PM CST
----------------------
TimelineLite 	0.561
TimelineMax	0.54
	- Fixed a bug in goto() that could render things incorrectly when a timeline is reversed.


4/30/2009, 12:05AM CST
---------------------
TweenMax	11.098
TimelineLite	0.56
	- **IMPORTANT** Changed reverse() and play() behavior so that play() ALWAYS forces the TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax instance to play forwards and reverse() ALWAYS forces it to play backwards. Previously, reverse() would flip directions, so if it was currently running backwards, reverse() would cause it to go forwards, etc. It proved to be confusing to end users, so I switched to the new behavior.
	- **IMPORTANT** The "reversed" setter in TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax does NOT automatically force the tween/timeline to resume. Previously it did.
	- Added resume() method to TweenMax/TimelineLite/TimelineMax which is similar to play() except it won't alter the direction of a tween (if it is reversed, it will stay reversed after calling resume()).
	- Added fromTo() and allFromTo() to TweenMax.
	- Added stop() to TweenMax to be consistent with the timeline classes


4/28/2009, 12:35AM CST
----------------------
TweenMax	 11.0971
TimelineLite 	 0.55
OverwriteManager 5.01
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TimelineMax repeat to render incorrectly because tweens could get overwritten
	- Added the ability to set the "reversed" property via the constructor's vars object in TweenMax, TimelineLite, and TimelineMax. 


4/27/2009, 1PM CST
------------------
TimelineLite	0.54
	- Fixed bug that could cause a TimelineMax repeat to render incorrectly


4/24/2009, 1:30AM CST
---------------------
TweenMax 	11.097
TweenLite 	11.097
TimelineLite 	0.53
TimelineMax	0.53
	- Minor changes that would prevent potential missed rendering of tweens/timelines that complete and then are re-enabled later
	- Added TweenEvent.REPEAT Event dispatching in TweenMax
	- Changed the way TweenLite/Max communicate with TweenPlugins (so the plugins can optionally sense when a tween gets disabled or when the plugin PropTween gets overwritten/removed) which was necessary for MotionBlurPlugin to handle overwriting properly.
	- Removed "renderOnStart" special property functionality, and replaced it with "immediateRender" which provides more flexibility.
	- Reduced size of TweenPlugin slightly
	- Minor optimizations
	- Fixed MotionBlurPlugin overwrite bug
	- Fixed MotionBlurPlugin bug that prevented blurring when a tween was reversed or yoyo'd
